To run the project, use Docker Compose. The process involves two main steps:

Running MongoDB in the Background

Explanation:

- `up`: Creates and starts the containers.
- `-d`: Runs the services in detached mode.
- `mongodb`: The name of the service you want to start (defined in docker-compose.yml).

Running the Application in Interactive Mode

```bash
docker-compose run app
